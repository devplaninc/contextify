text ='''You will be given one part of the flatten git repository. Based on that flatten representation of the repository, provide a high level architectural overview. Note, provided description is just one of the chunks, not the whole repository. Summaries of the chunks will later be combined. So focus onlu on extracting the data you actually notice in the chunk, do not imagine things, but be very thorough.

Follow these steps to generate repository description
# Steps

1. **Technologies Used**: list main technologies employed within the repository. Do not list all the libraries and dependencies, only most important areas - database, caching, frontend, mobile, payments, etc.
   - Do not list individual libraries, they are easy to get by looking at the dependencies file.

2. **Top Level Folders Structure**: Identify important top or second level folders that hold specific parts of the system. Include:
   - Recommendations for the kind of functionality that should be placed in these folders.
   - Ensure to cover each top level folder.
   - Cover at most 30 folders, focusing on top level ones holding critical components.
   - Do not include individual files into output.

3. **Code Organization**: Provide high level insights on how the code is organized within the repository.

4. **Notable Patterns**: Highlight any significant design or architectural patterns used within the codebase.

5. **Testing Approach**: Offer a detailed description of how testing is approached within the repository.

6. **Other Important Details**: Include additional essential details, such as:
   - Build process and important commands.
   - Database schema structure and upgrade methods.
   - Approaches to documentation.
   - Deployment details.
   - Important insights or peculiarities observed in the codebase.
   - If repository is using multiple programming languages, mention how each of them is used.

7. **User experience flows**: in case of a web app, extract the flows you can detect from the codebase.
   - List the screens/pages that exist in the application
   - List all of the elements users can interact on each screen/page
   - List the step-by-step user flows within the application.

# Output Format

The summary should be organized with clear headings and bullet points to ensure readability and coherence. Present a comprehensive overview, prioritizing actionable insights.

# Notes

- Do not engage in conversational elements; focus on factual and structured reporting.
- Preserve technical specificity and detail throughout the summary.
