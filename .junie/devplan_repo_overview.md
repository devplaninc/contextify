# High Level Overview of the Repository

This repository appears to be a Python-based project focused on observing and analyzing software repositories, specifically GitHub repositories. It leverages various tools and libraries for cloning, processing, and summarizing code. The project includes functionalities for interacting with the GitHub API, combining repository contents, and tokenizing files for further processing, potentially for use with language models or other analysis tools.

## Technologies Used

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used throughout the project.
*   **GitHub API:** Used for interacting with GitHub repositories, retrieving information, and cloning.
*   **Git:** Used for cloning repositories.
*   **Protocol Buffers (protobuf):** Used for defining data structures for inter-service communication.
*   **Logging:** `structlog` and standard `logging` library are used for logging.
*   **Tokenization:** `tiktoken` library is used for tokenizing text, likely for use with language models.
*   **Environment Variables:** `.env` files and `load_dotenv` are used for managing environment-specific configurations.
*   **Testing:** `pytest` is used for testing the code.

## Top Level Folders Structure

## Code Organization

The code is organized into a modular structure, with clear separation of concerns. The `server/src/dev_observer` directory contains the core logic for observing and analyzing repositories. The code is further divided into sub-modules for specific tasks, such as cloning, parsing, and summarizing repositories. The use of packages and modules promotes code reusability and maintainability. The project uses Protocol Buffers for defining data structures, which suggests a focus on interoperability and potentially communication with other services.

## Notable Patterns

*   **Dependency Injection:** The `GithubProvider` class takes a `Auth` object in its constructor, demonstrating dependency injection.
*   **Abstract Class/Interface:** The `GitRepositoryProvider` class acts as an abstract class, defining an interface for interacting with Git repositories.
*   **Configuration:** The use of `.env` files and environment variables for configuration.
*   **Logging:** The use of `structlog` for structured logging.
*   **Command-line Interface:** The `process.py` script uses `argparse` to handle command-line arguments.

## Testing Approach

The project uses `pytest` for testing. The `server/tests/analysis/repository/test_parser.py` file contains unit tests for the `parse_github_url` function. The tests use `pytest.mark.parametrize` to test the function with various inputs and expected outputs.

## Other Important Details

*   **Build Process:** The project uses `pyproject.toml` and `hatchling` for build configuration.
*   **Database Schema/Upgrades:** The provided code does not include database interactions or schema management.
*   **Documentation:** The project includes `README.md` files for documentation.
*   **Deployment:** Deployment details are not explicitly mentioned in the provided code.
*   **Programming Languages:** The project primarily uses Python. Protocol Buffers are used for defining data structures.
*   **Environment Variables:** The project uses environment variables for configuration, such as `GITHUB_AUTH_TYPE` and `GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.
*   **File Combination:** The `summarizer.py` uses `repomix` to combine the repository files into a single markdown file.
*   **Tokenization:** The `summarizer.py` uses `tiktoken` to tokenize the combined file.
*   **GitHub Authentication:** The project uses a GitHub personal access token for authentication.

## User experience flows

Based on the provided code, the application's primary user flow involves:

1.  **Setup:**
    *   The user creates a `.env.local` file.
    *   The user adds `GITHUB_PERSONAL_TOKEN` to the `.env.local` file.
2.  **Execution:**
    *   The user runs the `scripts/analysis/process.py` script with the `--repo` argument, providing a GitHub repository URL.
    *   Example: `uv run scripts/analysis/process.py --repo git@github.com:devplaninc/webapp.git`
3.  **Processing:**
    *   The script clones the specified repository.
    *   The script combines the repository files into a single markdown file using `repomix`.
    *   The script tokenizes the combined file using `tiktoken`.
    *   The script cleans up the cloned repository and combined file (if `cleanup` is set to `True`).

**Screens/Pages:**

*   There are no explicit screens or pages in this application, as it is a command-line tool.

**Elements:**

*   **Command-line arguments:**
    *   `--repo`: The URL of the GitHub repository to analyze.

**User Flows:**

1.  **Analyze a GitHub Repository:**
    *   User provides a GitHub repository URL via the `--repo` argument.
    *   The script clones the repository.
    *   The script combines the repository files.
    *   The script tokenizes the combined file.
    *   The script outputs the tokenized files.
